\frametitle{Use of unconstrained and complement}

In case of 1 hypothesis of interest:\\
Use the complement.\\
It acts as another competing (non-overlapping) hypothesis.\\
~\\
In case of 2 or more hypotheses of interest:\\
Use the complement of the set, but this is not yet possible in the software.\\
So, use the unconstrained as failsafe.\\
This is used to check whether at least one of the hypothesis is not weak.\\
Then, the non-weak hypotheses can be compared to all other.
